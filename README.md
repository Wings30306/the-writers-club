# The Writers' Club

When I did the first project ([User Centric Frontend](https://wings30306.github.io/WingsBookClub/)), the main question I got from friends who write and read was: "Can you make it interactive so we can post our own stories and give feedback?" A few months have passed since, but it's here now: a website where you can post your own stories with no requirements: All stories are welcome here with no requirements or limitations for rating, genre, whether it's original or a fan fic, which fandom, how many chapters... and give feedback on other people's stories.

Happy reading / writing!
 
## UX
 


### User Stories
1.	As a reader, I would like to be able to read stories, preferably without signing in.
2.	**WIP** As a reader, I would like to see the ratings by other people to decide which story I would like to read.
4.	As a reader, I would like to be able to filter stories by fandom, genre, rating,…
5.	As a reader, I would like to give feedback for stories. I understand I’ll have to sign in to do this.
6.	As a reader, I would also like to rate stories when I give feedback.
7.	As a writer, I would like to easily add new chapters / stories.
8.	As a writer, I would like to be able to change already-uploaded chapters too, in case I find a mistake or typo that needs to be corrected.
9.	**WIP** As a writer, I would like to be able to upload a cover image for my story. If I don’t have a cover image, I'd like to have a choice of placeholder.
1.	**WIP** As a writer, I would like to receive any feedback in email so I don’t always have to check the site for new posts.
1.	As a writer, I would like to be able to add a keyword (new genre, new fandom,…) if the one applicable to my story isn’t listed yet.
1.	**WIP** As a writer, I would like to know how many times my story has been read. Visualisation (statistical graphs)  would be also be  nice for this. Perhaps a dashboard for each author, to be accessed on sign-in?
1.	As an admin, I would like to be able to suspend or block users who don’t follow the terms and conditions, for example those who post spam or don’t follow the guidelines for appropriate conduct.
1. As an admin, I'd like to be able to delete inappropriate comments in feedback or edit the story characteristics if they were put in incorrectly.


This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Allowing users to upload their own cover image for a story.

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
